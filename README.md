# You've Got To Be Kidding!
A faithful client-side recreation of the 2001 PBS Kids web game "You've Got To Be Kidding," which was based on the animated educational television series *Arthur*.

## How does this work?
The original game was available on https://pbskids.org starting from 2001, but became unavailable at some point in 2020. The game chose random questions and answers entirely server-side, which means that the original game can probably be considered "lost media." However, nearly every asset used by the game is available on archive.org, which means that it is entirely possible to recreate the game nearly perfectly based on the how the original game functioned. This repository hosts all the assets used by the game along with a recreation of the server-side functionality in JavaScript.
